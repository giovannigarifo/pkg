Implementation of an R-GCN based model for node embedding using [Deep Graph Library](https://www.dgl.ai/).

`serialized.xml` containes in XML format the RDF description of a graph.


# Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN)

RGCNs are a kind of GraphConvNet that operates on [knowledge graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Graph). 

The main difference with respect to classical GCNs that operates on graphs is that RGCNs operates on multigraphs with labeled edges.
